# Suica Yamazaki Website

## Development

To test the theme, run this. (Using the `--trace` flag for verbose errors.)

```sh
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --trace
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`

As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
